/*
	Constructor : 
        - Constructor is a function which name is same as class name and 
          having no return type.
				  
	    - Constructor is a special method that is invoked automatically 
		  at the time of object creation.

		- It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.

        - Constructors are used to initialize the data members of the object and perform any necessary setup.


	Constuctor is of three type.
        1.Default or Non-parameterized
        2.Parameterized
        3.Copy


	Default Constructor : 
        - Default Constructors donâ€™t have input argument however.

		- If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default 
          constructor for object (expects no parameters and has an empty body).

        - A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters. 
          It is automatically called when an object is created if no other constructor is specified.

	Parameterized Constructor : 
        - A parameterized constructor accepts one or more parameters to initialize 
          the object with specific values.

	Copy Constructor : 
        - A copy constructor creates a new object by copying the values of another 
          object of the same class. It is used when objects are passed by value or when objects are created as
