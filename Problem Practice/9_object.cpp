    Objects : 
        - An object is an instance of a class. 
        - Objects are the fundamental building blocks of OOP and are used to model and represent real-world entities or concepts in your program.
        
        Here are the key characteristics and concepts related to objects in C++ OOP:

            - Instance of a Class: 
                An object is created based on a class definition. 
                The class acts as a blueprint or template that defines the structure 
                (data members) and behavior (member functions) that objects of that 
                class will have.

            - Data and Behavior: 
                Objects encapsulate both data (attributes or properties) and 
                behavior (methods or functions). 
                The data represents the state of the object, while the behavior 
                defines the actions or operations that can be performed on the 
                object's data.

            - Instantiation: 
                Creating an object is referred to as "instantiating" the class. 
                When you create an object, memory is allocated for its data members, 
                and the constructor (a special member function) is called to initialize the object.

            - Identity: 
                Each object has a unique identity, which distinguishes it 
                from other objects. Even if two objects of the same class have 
                the same data values, they are still distinct objects with 
                separate memory locations.

            - Usage: 
                Objects are used to interact with the data and behavior defined by 
                the class. You can invoke methods on objects, access their data 
                members, and modify their state.
