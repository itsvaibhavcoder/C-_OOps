    Friend Class :
        A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes
        in which it is declared as a friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a
        particular class to access private and protected members of other classes.
        For example, a LinkedList class may be allowed to access private members of
        Node.We can declare a friend class in C++ by using the friend keyword.

    We can declare friend class or function anywhere in the base class body whether
    its private, protected or public block. It works all the same.
